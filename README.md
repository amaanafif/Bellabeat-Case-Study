# Bellabeat-Case-Study
Welcome to the Bellabeat data analysis case study! In this case study, we will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data
analyst. You will imagine you are working for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, and
meet different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions, you will follow the steps of the
data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
